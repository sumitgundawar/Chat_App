#Chat App with NodeJS Backend and Vite Frontend

##Overview This Chat App is built with NodeJS as the backend and Vite as the frontend, utilizing ChatEngine's API for user authentication and chat functionality. The application supports sending messages, images, and files, along with features like individual and group chats. It integrates libraries such as express, cors, axios, and react-chat-engine-pretty.

##Getting Started To run the project, follow the steps below:

##Backend:

1. Open the terminal and navigate to the backend directory. <br>cd backend

2. Start the NodeJS server. <br>npm run start

3. Stop the server by pressing ctrl + c.

##Frontend:

1. Open a new terminal window and navigate to the frontend directory. <br>cd frontend

2. Start the Vite project with React. <br>npm run dev

3. Stop the server by entering q and pressing enter.

##ChatEngine Integration This Chat App currently uses the free trial account for ChatEngine, which provides a 30-day trial period with a 14-day chat history. For a full-scale commercial project, you will need to purchase the appropriate ChatEngine plan. Explore more about ChatEngine here.

##Note Ensure that you have two separate terminals open, one for the backend and one for the frontend, to run the complete project successfully.
